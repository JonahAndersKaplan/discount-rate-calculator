A tool to calculate future benefits as a lump sum in BC litigation. None of the information provided herein is intended as legal advice. Do not rely on any of this information as legal advice. If you have a legal problem, consult a lawyer.

Examples:

- - Lisa was born on Jan 1, 1982.
  - She was denied benefits on Jan 1, 2022.
  - Her net monthly benefit is $1000 less CPPD.
  - Her benefits would be paid until she turns 65.
  - Lisa turns 65 on Jan 1, 2047.
  - We can calculate Lisa’s benefit period as 2022-2047, a period of 25 years.
  - Her benefits as a lump sum before applying the discount rate would be $300,000 ($1000 x 12 x 25).

  - Lisa hires a lawyer that sends a settlement proposal on Jan 1, 2023.
  - The settlement proposal calculates the amount owing as follows:
  - Past benefits owing (from date of denial [Jan 1, 2022] to Jan 1, 2023):
    $1000 x 12 x 1 = $12,000
  - Future benefits owing (from date after proposal [Jan 2, 2023] to Jan 1, 2047):
    $1000 x 12 x 20.0304 = $240,364.80 - Lisa has 24 years from the date of her letter until retirement at age 65. - 20.0304 is taken from the Present Value Table at Year 24, 1.5%.
  - Total demanded: $252,364.80 + (punitive damages and aggravated damages) + costs & disbursements - $12,000 + $240,364.80

Claim

1. Determine the Number of Years Remaining on the
   Claim
   This should be from the date of denial to the end date prescribed in the claim
   (usually 65 [age of retirement]).

Calculating LTD Benefits as a Lump Sum 3

Lisa was born on Jan 1, 1982. She was denied benefits on Jan 1, 2022. Her net
monthly benefit is $1000 less CPPD. Her benefits would be paid until she turns 65.
Lisa turns 65 on Jan 1, 2047.
We can calculate Lisa’s benefit period as 2022-2047, a period of 25 years.
Her benefits as a lump sum before applying the discount rate would be
$300,000 ($1000 x 12 x 25).
Daniel was born on Feb 3, 1970. He was denied benefits on Oct 25, 2021. He was
denied CPPD. His monthly benefit is $1642.37. His policy would be paid until he
turns 65.
Daniel turns 65 on Feb 3, 2035.
His benefit period would be Oct 25, 2021 to Feb 3, 2035, a period of 13.28
years (4849 days).
His benefits as a lump sum before applying the discount rate would be
$261,728. 08 ($1642.37 x 12 x 13.28). 2. Apply the Discount Rate

CIVJI, Appendix E—Present Value Table
Discount rates are used by courts to determine the present day value of a loss of
future income, i.e. a loss of LTD benefits payable into the future. The discount rate
assumes that the lump sum will be invested and earn interest, so that in the long-term
the present value will equate to a full payout of the future benefits.
s. 56(2) of BC Law and Equity Act and the Law and Equity Regulation determine the
discount rate. The Regulation sets the current rate at 1.5%. This rate accounts for
interest rates, inflation rates, and labour productivity.
Since past benefits due have nothing to do with the future, they can be calculated using
the date of a letter or mediation.
The discount rate is straightforward to apply. Simply take the number of future years
remaining on the policy, consult the number listed in the table of Appendix E, and

Calculating LTD Benefits as a Lump Sum 4
multiply that amount by the annual benefit owed.
Take a look at these examples:
Lisa hires a lawyer that sends a settlement proposal on Jan 1, 2023. The settlement
proposal calculates the amount owing as follows:
Past benefits owing (from date of denial [Jan 1, 2022] to Jan 1, 2023):
$1000 x 12 x 1 = $12,000
Future benefits owing (from date after proposal [Jan 2, 2023] to Jan 1, 2047):
$1000 x 12 x 20.0304 = $240,364.80
Lisa has 24 years from the date of her letter until retirement at age 65.
20.0304 is taken from the Present Value Table at Year 24, 1.5%.
Total demanded: $252,364.80 + (punitive damages and aggravated damages) +
costs & disbursements
$12,000 + $240,364.80
Daniel’s lawyer is unable to reach a settlement and sets a mediation date for
December 5, 2022. His lawyer calculates his benefits owing as follows:
Past benefits owing (from date of denial [Oct 25, 2021] to Dec 5, 2022):
$1642.37 x 12 x 1.11 = $21,876.37
Future benefits owing (from date after mediation [Dec 6, 2022] to Feb 3, 2035):
$1642.37 x 12 x 10.9075 = $214,969
Daniel has 12.1698 years from the date of mediation until retirement at age 65.
10.9075 is taken from the Present Value Table at Year 12, 1.5%.
The 10.9075 figure accounts for 12 years, but the loss in future benefits to
Daniel is 12.1698 years. You may want to account for this by calculating the
fraction for Year 13 and applying that to the remaining 0.1698 year amount:
11.7315 / 13 = .9024
.9024 x 0.1698 = 0.1532
0.1532 x $1642.37 x 12 = $3019.33

Calculating LTD Benefits as a Lump Sum 5

We can then add $3019.33 to the amount owed in future benefits:
Total demanded: $239,864.70 + (punitive damages and aggravated damages) +
costs & disbursements
$21,876.37 + $214,969 + $3019.33
Some lawyers do not account for the discount rate in their settlement proposals or
mediation briefs. Of course, this means that you will start with a higher number for
your initial offer, but DC will likely immediately ask you to account for the discount
rate. This is your call—excluding mention or calculation of the discount rate from
your correspondence with DC may bring your competence into question.
